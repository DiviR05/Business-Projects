# Customer Engagement and Health Outcomes Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard to analyze customer engagement data and identify trends related to health outcomes. The dashboard will help uncover key metrics and patterns to improve customer engagement and health outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:
- **user_id**: Unique identifiers for each user.
- **session_duration**: Session durations in seconds.
- **clicks_per_session**: Number of clicks per session.
- **conversion**: Binary values indicating whether a conversion occurred (0 or 1).
- **date**: Dates for the sessions.
- **age**: Ages of users.
- **gender**: Genders of users.
- **location**: Locations of users.
- **device_type**: Types of devices used (Mobile, Desktop, Tablet).
- **subscription_type**: Types of subscriptions (Free, Basic, Premium).
- **health_status**: User-reported health status (e.g., "Good", "Fair", "Poor").
- **healthcare_visits**: Frequency of healthcare visits per month.
- **blood_pressure**: Blood pressure levels.
- **glucose_levels**: Glucose levels.
- **medication_adherence**: Binary values indicating whether users are adhering to prescribed medications (0 or 1).
- **exercise_frequency**: Frequency of exercise sessions per week.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- **Load the Dataset**: Import the dataset into the analysis environment.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate summary statistics for key columns.
- **Visualizations**: Create initial visualizations to understand the distribution of data.

### 3. Key Metrics Identification
- **Engagement Metrics**: Identify key metrics such as average session duration, average clicks per session, and conversion rates.
- **Health Metrics**: Identify key health metrics such as average blood pressure, glucose levels, and healthcare visits.

### 4. Advanced Analysis
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze correlations between engagement metrics and health outcomes.
- **Regression Analysis**: Perform regression analysis to understand the impact of engagement metrics on health outcomes.
- **Trend Analysis**: Examine trends over time to see how engagement metrics and health outcomes change.

### 5. Visualization and Dashboard Creation
- **Dashboard Design**: Use a BI tool like Looker to design a dashboard. Include charts and graphs that highlight key performance indicators (KPIs).
- **Interactive Elements**: Add interactive elements like filters and drill-downs to allow users to explore the data in more detail.

### 6. Insights and Recommendations
- **Report Generation**: Create a detailed report summarizing findings. Include visualizations and key insights.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Provide recommendations based on the analysis. Explain how these insights can improve customer engagement and health outcomes.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization (libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- **Looker**: For creating interactive dashboards.
- **SQL**: For querying and manipulating data.
